# Fake-Review-Detection-and-Semantic-Search-with-Review-Summarization
## 1. Research Problem and Motivation 
Platforms such as Amazon, Yelp, and TripAdvisor help with customer’s purchasing 
decisions using product reviews. Unfortunately, the emergence of fake reviews written to 
artificially improve products’ rating scores undermines market integrity and trust. Classic 
methods focus on rule-based systems or human-based filtering processes that are overly 
simplistic and hard to enforce. 
The objective of this proposal is to create a sophisticated tool known as Fake Review 
Detector which seeks to accomplish automated and accurate detection of fake reviews. 
Furthermore, the system will provide users with explainable comments to enhance 
understanding as to why a given review is purported to be fake. Solving such a problem 
deepens understanding of complex systems and increases the capability of modern NLP 
systems. 
## 2. NLP Techniques 
In practical and academic respects, the system goals are achieved by the application of 
modern NLP techniques as stated below: 
1. Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs): 
o Fine-tune BERT and DeBERTa models on the fake review datasets for both 
label and classification. 
o Use adapter layers for efficient modeling or Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning 
(PEFT). 
2. Semantic Search and Information Retrieval: 
o Integrate Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for the generation of semantic 
embeddings. 
o Conduct similarity measures for the identification of repetition or bulk 
detection such as near-duplicate reviews pseudo duplication which is prevalent 
amongst fake reviews. 
3. Explainable Summarization: 
o Provide T5 or BART-derived models that succinctly explain the reasons for 
the review being flagged as suspicious to the user. 
4. Efficient NLP Deployment: 
o Optimize and deploy models on low-powered devices using model distillation 
to enhance inference time at the expense of model performance. 
@@ 3. Datasets and Tools to Be Used 
Datasets: 
• Amazon Review Dataset: Gives access to millions of product reviews along with 
metadata useful for detecting fake patterns. 
• Filtered Yelp Reviews Dataset: Contains reviews flagged by the Yelp algorithm as 
fake for their reviews. 
• Kaggle Datasets of Fake Reviews: Other cross-validation data sets to check the 
robustness of the model. 
Tools & Libraries: 
• Python for development 
• Hugging Face Transformers for model fine-tuning (BERT, RoBERTa, T5, BART) 
• scikit-learn for baseline machine learning models. 
• FastAPI for backend API development 
• React for the frontend interface. 
• Heroku for deployment 
## 4. Evaluation Metrics 
To evaluate the performance of our models, we will use the following metrics: 
1. Classification Metrics (for Fake Review Detection): 
o Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model. 
o Precision: Ability to correctly identify fake reviews without false positives. 
o Recall: Ability to detect all actual fake reviews (minimizing false negatives). 
o F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. 
2. Semantic Search Metrics: 
o Cosine Similarity Score: To evaluate the effectiveness of semantic matching 
between reviews. 
3. Explainability Evaluation (Qualitative): 
o User Feedback: Conduct small-scale user tests to assess the clarity and 
usefulness of the generated explanations. 
4. Efficiency Metrics (Post-Optimization): 
o Model Size Reduction: Percentage decrease after distillation. 
o Inference Time: Speed of prediction in milliseconds. 
## 5. Expected Outcomes 
• A web-based application that identifies fake reviews with great precision and is fully 
functional. 
• An AI model that flags reviews with justifications that are easy for humans to 
comprehend and understand. 
• A deployable solution for NLP that has been designed for high performance and 
efficiency.
